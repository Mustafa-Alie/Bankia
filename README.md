Bankia:

This is a simple website project built for practicing frontend development skills. The project is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on applying the BEM (Block Element Modifier) approach for better maintainability and scalability of the codebase.





Technologies Used:

JavaScript: The project utilizes JavaScript for dynamic and interactive features on the website.

HTML: The structure of the website is created using HTML, providing a semantic and accessible foundation.

CSS: Styling is achieved through CSS to enhance the visual appeal and layout of the website.

BEM Approach:
The project follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming and organizing CSS classes. BEM promotes a modular and systematic approach to styling, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.






Purpose:

This website is created for learning purposes and is not intended for real-world use. It serves as a practical exercise for honing frontend development skills, applying best practices in coding, and gaining hands-on experience.
